You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
        To access the .env file, we need to use the dotenv package and adding {require('dotenv').config()} to app.js. We can access 
        it then with {process.env.{variable_name}}.
    How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?
        You can protect the content of the .env file by including it in the .gitignore file by adding ".env" to the file.
